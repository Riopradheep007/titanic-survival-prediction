# titanic-survival-prediction
I took this project in kaggle.The main moto of this project is to predict the survival ofhuman in the titanic disaster.

Execution of the code:
   1. first run the future engineering.py In that code I did all the feature engineering part.
      All the datas are cleaned,now the data is ready to run the machine learning model.
   
   2.cross validate the different model and then I choose the best model for prediction.
   
    
   3.finally run the main code which will give you a prediction.
     Run:Main.py
     
     
   4.final_submission_result.csv is a my final output I had got from my model.
